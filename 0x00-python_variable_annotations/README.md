 This directory contains the solutions to the programming tasks of the Python Variable Annotations project, which was done at the ALX Software Engineering School. While doing this project, I learnt:
-Type annotations in Python 3
-How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
-Duck typing
-How to validate your code with mypy
